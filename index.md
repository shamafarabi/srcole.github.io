I’m a PhD student studying [neuroscience at UC San Diego](http://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/education/neurograd/Pages/default.aspx) and working in the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com) studying brain rhythms. Specifically, I am working on a new analysis framework to extract more information from neural signals by parametrizing the waveform shapes of the brain rhythms. You can learn more about this in our recent [review](http://voyteklab.com/wp-content/uploads/Cole-TrendsCognSci2017.pdf) and [methods paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/16/302000).

Otherwise, my main passion is in uncovering trends in data. Though I hope I'll be able to apply these skills to improving public good in the future, you can [see a list of my projects here](https://github.com/srcole/projects) ranging from burritos to text mining to police misconduct.
