I'm an aspiring data scientist and current [fellow at Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/). You can [see a list of my data-related projects here](https://srcole.github.io/dataprojects/) ranging from burritos to text mining to police misconduct ([CV](https://srcole.github.io/assets/misc/cv.pdf), [resume](https://srcole.github.io/assets/misc/resume.pdf)). While my amateur approach to data science has been fun, I am hoping to have a greater impact on the world by joining the tech industry. Or at the very least, I’ll get to learn cool new things.

I recently finished a PhD in [neuroscience at UC San Diego](http://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/education/neurograd/Pages/default.aspx) while working in the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com) studying brain rhythms. Specifically, I developed a new analysis framework to extract novel information from neural signals by parametrizing the waveform shapes of the brain rhythms. You can learn more about our motivations in this [review paper](http://voyteklab.com/wp-content/uploads/Cole-TrendsCognSci2017.pdf) and the techniques in this [methods paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/16/302000).
