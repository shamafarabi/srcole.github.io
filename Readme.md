# Scott Cole's webpage

This repo contains all the code and materials for my webpage, http://srcole.github.io. A few notes about this webpage:
* It is a new version of my former [wordpress-based webpage](http://sxcole.com)
* The older blog posts (pre- July 2016) have not been formatted for this webpage.
* I adapted this webpage from [Andrej's Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/)

## TODO
* Format html in blog posts
* Add Fb to footer
* More posts!
