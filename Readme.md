# Scott's website repo

I am attempting to move [my website](http://sxcole.com) to github.io instead of wordpress. Hopefully it'll be up soon!

I adapted this webpage from [Andrej's Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/)

## TODO
* Add blogposts from sxcole
* get rid of rss thing
* add a description
* add a fb link
* expand about... work page on sxcole
