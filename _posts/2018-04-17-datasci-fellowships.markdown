Iâ€™m looking into opportunities after finishing grad school, and data science fellowships seem especially appealing. I came across quite a few and wanted to organize them and share them with others in a similar position. You can see the details of these fellowships in the table below, or in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VJEYwI0vFjyA3iC46CtHX4mgAWEcd9EWzaqdu9ebOYM/edit?usp=sharing).
