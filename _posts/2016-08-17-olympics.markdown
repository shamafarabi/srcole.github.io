## Weighting gold vs. silver vs. bronze medals
After each Olympic games, there's often a debate of which country "won" the Olympics. This debate is often between
people who disagree on whether the total number of medals or the number of gold medals is most important. Of course,
the answer for most of us lies somewhere in between, and using the interactive data visualization below, we can
weight the value of each medal and see how that affects each country's standing.

In this visualization, you can additionally select a country on the map and see in the bar chart how their medal count
faired in each sport. Additionally, you can select a sport by clicking on its name below the bar chart and the map
above will update to show the weighted medal score for each country for only that sport. And by clicking on
the bar above, you can update the map to show only the worldwide distribution of a certain medal type (gold, silver,
 or bronze).

## Adjusting medal weights for each sport
By observing the total number of medals awarded in each sport, I still don't think the weighted medal count above is
sufficient. Why should swimming be more than twice as important than any other sport when deciding which country
performed best in the Olympic games? Because of this, I wanted to also weight the medals in each sport separately,
and this visualization will come later.
