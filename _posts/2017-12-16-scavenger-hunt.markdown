Personalized scavenger hunts are fun, and they make good gifts. They can be made surprisingly quickly too. I set up the following scavenger hunt in about 3 hours, and you can make one too! Below are some suggestions for planning the hunt and some of my favorite clue ideas. [Click here to see the full example of a scavenger hunt with 20 clues](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lDsjwv3D6w5RII5HuMUvhD658uMgvG-6c6ajLu0YaWs/edit?usp=sharing).

### Planning a scavenger hunt
* Walk around the house and make a list of potential places to hide clues
	* e.g. inside a coin bank, underneath that stupid plant
* Aim for objects that have a personal connection
	* e.g. that infamous Signals & Systems textbook you both used in undergrad
* Brainstorm clue types
	* e.g. word scramble, symbols, drawing, physical items (keys!)
* Create a clue for each item
	* e.g. a money symbol (to represent the coin bank)
	* create bizarre clues when possible
* Plan the order of the clues
	* start with something easy. Save the really exciting ones for the end.
	* see if different items would connect well to one another.
* Logistics
	* allot sufficient time alone on the premesis to hide the clues
	* pick hiding places that likely won't be uncovered before you want the hunt to begin
* Try not to make the clues too easy or too difficult
	* Ideally, I want there to be several wrong guesses, or about 10 minutes of thinking
	* Offer clues when needed.
* Let the scavenger hunt lead them to a main present at the end.
