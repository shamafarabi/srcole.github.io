I’m a PhD student studying [neuroscience at UC San Diego](http://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/education/neurograd/Pages/default.aspx), currently researching the functions and measures of neural oscillations in the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com). 

My main passion is in discovering statistical trends in data. In the future, I hope my analytics will serve the public good. But at this stage, my outreach is limited to education and entertainment, so I always try to couple my analyses with open code and data. Some of my projects have included:

* Burritos in San Diego [[1](https://srcole.github.io/100burritos/)] [[2](https://srcole.github.io/2016/08/31/luchalibre/)] [[3](https://srcole.github.io/2015/08/30/burrito1/)]
* Poster popularity at the Society for Neuroscience Meeting [[1](https://srcole.github.io/2016/11/27/sfnthemes/)] [[2](https://srcole.github.io/2016/12/12/sfnstates/)]
* Currency trading [[1](http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/18621418/clemson-students-made-40000)] [[2](https://github.com/srcole/fxml)]
* Flight delay [[1](https://srcole.github.io/2017/04/02/flight_delay/)]]

In addition to those projects, I'm also interested in:

* Data visualization [[Tableau vizs](https://public.tableau.com/profile/scott.cole#!/)]
* Writing miscellaneous Python tutorials tangentially related to data analysis [[1](https://srcole.github.io/2016/01/18/emd/)] [[2](https://srcole.github.io/2016/07/29/paperdata/)] [[3](https://srcole.github.io/2017/01/03/osg_python/)]
* Probability and math [[1](https://srcole.github.io/2015/06/14/guess/)] [[2](https://srcole.github.io/2015/05/25/medianguess/)] [[3](https://srcole.github.io/2015/06/23/farey/)]

**Neuroscience research ([CV](https://srcole.github.io/assets/cv.pdf))**

* __Oscillation shape.__ ([Cole & Voytek 2017](http://voyteklab.com/wp-content/uploads/Cole-TrendsCognSci_inpress.pdf)) Currently, almost all frequency analysis approaches implement Fourier techniques. However, this presumes a sinusoidal basis whereas neural oscillations are commonly nonsinusoidal. We are developing methods to extract information from the waveform shape.
* __Parkinson's Disease.__ ([Cole et al., 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/19/049304)) This preprint presents an argument that neural activity in the motor cortex of Parkinson's Disease patients is hypersynchronous.
* __Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)__ is a phenomenon in neural electrophysiology in which oscillations at two different frequencies are coupled to one another. Along with post-doc Erik Peterson, we created a library for estimating PAC ([Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pacpy)) ([MATLAB](https://github.com/voytekresearch/pacmat))

**Neuroscience teaching**

* Filtering neural signals and processing oscillation amplitude ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIK5bfoTnlg), [Problem set](https://github.com/srcole/neurodemo/tree/master/Fourier%20analysis/ProblemSet1))
* Calculating phase and coherence in neural signals ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAipVT_B_GY), [Problem set](https://github.com/srcole/neurodemo/tree/master/Fourier%20analysis/ProblemSet2))
* [Spectral analysis tutorials (Voytek Lab)](https://github.com/voytekresearch/tutorials) - Our lab releases tutorials (with IPython Notebook &amp; Binder) on the techniques we use to analyze neural signals
* [Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) tutorial](https://github.com/srcole/binder_emd) - A decomposition method to separate a temporal signal into its component oscillations, an alternative to Fourier analysis
