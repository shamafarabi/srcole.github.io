I’m a PhD student studying [neuroscience at UC San Diego](http://healthsciences.ucsd.edu/education/neurograd/Pages/default.aspx), currently researching the functions and measures of neural oscillations in the [Voytek lab](https://voyteklab.com). 

My main passion is in uncovering statistical trends in data. Though I hope I'll be able to apply these tools to improving public good in the future, some of my projects so far have included:

* Burritos in San Diego [[1](https://srcole.github.io/100burritos/)] [[2](https://srcole.github.io/2016/08/31/luchalibre/)] [[3](https://srcole.github.io/2015/08/30/burrito1/)] [[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp6jFy4_bV4&t)]
* Poster popularity at the Society for Neuroscience Meeting [[1](https://srcole.github.io/2016/11/27/sfnthemes/)] [[2](https://srcole.github.io/2016/12/12/sfnstates/)]
* Currency trading [[1](http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/18621418/clemson-students-made-40000)] [[2](https://github.com/srcole/fxml)]
* Data visualization [[Tableau vizs](https://public.tableau.com/profile/scott.cole#!/)]
* Miscellaneous data-related Python tutorials [[1](https://srcole.github.io/2016/01/18/emd/)] [[2](https://srcole.github.io/2016/07/29/paperdata/)] [[3](https://srcole.github.io/2017/01/03/osg_python/)] [[4](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp/tree/master/tutorials)]

**Neuroscience research ([CV](https://srcole.github.io/assets/misc/cv.pdf), [resume](https://srcole.github.io/assets/misc/resume.pdf))**

* __Oscillation shape.__ ([Cole & Voytek 2017](http://voyteklab.com/wp-content/uploads/Cole-TrendsCognSci_inpress.pdf)) Currently, almost all frequency analysis approaches implement Fourier techniques. However, this presumes a sinusoidal basis whereas neural oscillations are commonly nonsinusoidal. We are developing methods to extract information from the waveform shape.
* __Parkinson's Disease.__ ([Cole et al., 2017](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/18/4830)) This preprint presents an argument that neural activity in the motor cortex of Parkinson's Disease patients is hypersynchronous.
* __Signal processing__ ([Neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp)) Our lab is organizing a standard libary for the tools we use to process and analyze neural signals. This includes tutorials for new lab members, or anyone who is interested in learning the techniques.
* __Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)__ is a phenomenon in neural electrophysiology in which oscillations at two different frequencies are coupled to one another. Along with post-doc Erik Peterson, we created a library for estimating PAC ([Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pacpy)) ([MATLAB](https://github.com/voytekresearch/pacmat))
