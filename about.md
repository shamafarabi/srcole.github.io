My name is Scott Cole.
Iâ€™m a PhD student studying neuroscience at UC San Diego, currently researching the functions and measures of neural oscillations in the [Voytek lab](http://voyteklab.com). 
Outside of research I love maths, am an amateur currency trader and beach volleyball player, yet a professional burrito reviewer of San Diego.
